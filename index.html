I enjoy watching and playing sports, espeically golf and basketball. I am a technology fanatic (also an Apple fanboy).
I also love music, specifically hip-hop and alternative. Some of my favorite artists right now are Kendrick Lamar, Travis Scott, Tame Impala, and Kanye West.
Kanye West has been a huge inspiration for me, I love his music and his other artistic ventures, such as fashion.
</p>

<p>My three favorite Kanye West albums </p>
    <ul>
        <li>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</li>
        <li>The Life of Pablo</li>
        <li>Yeezus</li>
    </ul>

Kanye got me really interested in sneakers and fashion, to the point where I was heavily considering going to fashion school. I still would love to go one day, perhaps after I finish here at Ohio State.
